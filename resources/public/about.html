            <p>
                As a citizen of Ireland, I have spent my life voting in a system that is counted using the
                <b>Proportional
                    Representation Single Transferable Vote</b> method. I can&rsquo;t say that I understood it very
                well. I simply understood that you should fill in several preferences on the ballot, since my vote could be
                transferred to help elect other, lower-preference candidates.
            </p>
            </br>
            <p> As an attempt to understand the system in more detail, I built this web application. </p>
